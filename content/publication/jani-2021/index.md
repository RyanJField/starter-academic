abstract: 'Background: Alcohol consumption is a leading contributor to death and disability
  worldwide, but previous research has not examined the effects of different patterns
  of alcohol consumption. The study objective was to understand the relationship between
  different alcohol consumption patterns and adverse health outcomes risk, adjusting
  for average amount consumed among regular drinkers. Methods: This was a prospective
  cohort study of UK Biobank (UKB) participants. Abstainers, infrequent alcohol consumers
  or those with previous cancer, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or liver cirrhosis
  were excluded. We used beverage type, consumption with food and consumption frequency
  as exposures and adjusted for potential confounding. All-cause mortality, major
  cardiovascular events-MACE (MI/stroke/cardiovascular death), accidents/injuries,
  liver cirrhosis, all-cause and alcohol-related cancer incidence over 9-year median
  follow-up period were outcomes of interest. Results: The final sample size for analysis
  was N = 309,123 (61.5% of UKB sample). Spirit drinking was associated with higher
  adjusted mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.25; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.14–1.38),
  MACE (HR 1.31; 95% CI 1.15–1.50), cirrhosis (HR 1.48; 95% CI 1.08–2.03) and accident/injuries
  (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1.03–1.19) risk compared to red wine drinking, after adjusting
  for the average weekly alcohol consumption amounts. Beer/cider drinkers were also
  at a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.18; 95% CI 1.10–1.27), MACE (HR 1.16; 95% CI
  1.05–1.27), cirrhosis (HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.06–1.74) and accidents/injuries (HR 1.11;
  95% CI 1.06–1.17). Alcohol consumption without food was associated with higher adjusted
  mortality (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02–1.17) risk, compared to consumption with food. Alcohol
  consumption over 1–2 times/week had higher adjusted mortality (HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.03–1.16)
  and MACE (HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.06–1.23) risk, compared to 3–4 times/week, adjusting
  for the amount of alcohol consumed. Conclusion: Red wine drinking, consumption with
  food and spreading alcohol intake over 3–4 days were associated with lower risk
  of mortality and vascular events among regular alcohol drinkers, after adjusting
  for the effects of average amount consumed. Selection bias and residual confounding
  are important possible limitations. These findings, if replicated and validated,
  have the potential to influence policy and practice advice on less harmful patterns
  of alcohol consumption.'
