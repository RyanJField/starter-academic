abstract: 'Background: Following the initial identification of the 2019 coronavirus
  disease (covid-19), the subsequent months saw substantial increases in published
  biomedical research. Concerns have been raised in both scientific and lay press
  around the quality of some of this research. We assessed clinical research from
  major clinical journals, comparing methodological and reporting quality of covid-19
  papers published in the first wave (here defined as December 2019 to May 2020 inclusive)
  of the viral pandemic with non-covid papers published at the same time. Methods:
  We reviewed research publications (print and online) from The BMJ, Journal of the
  American Medical Association (JAMA), The Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine,
  from first publication of a covid-19 research paper (February 2020) to May 2020
  inclusive. Paired reviewers were randomly allocated to extract data on methodological
  quality (risk of bias) and reporting quality (adherence to reporting guidance) from
  each paper using validated assessment tools. A random 10% of papers were assessed
  by a third, independent rater. Overall methodological quality for each paper was
  rated high, low or unclear. Reporting quality was described as percentage of total
  items reported. Results: From 168 research papers, 165 were eligible, including
  54 (33%) papers with a covid-19 focus. For methodological quality, 18 (33%) covid-19
  papers and 83 (73%) non-covid papers were rated as low risk of bias, OR 6.32 (95%CI
  2.85 to 14.00). The difference in quality was maintained after adjusting for publication
  date, results, funding, study design, journal and raters (OR 6.09 (95%CI 2.09 to
  17.72)). For reporting quality, adherence to reporting guidelines was poorer for
  covid-19 papers, mean percentage of total items reported 72% (95%CI:66 to 77) for
  covid-19 papers and 84% (95%CI:81 to 87) for non-covid. Conclusions: Across various
  measures, we have demonstrated that covid-19 research from the first wave of the
  pandemic was potentially of lower quality than contemporaneous non-covid research.
  While some differences may be an inevitable consequence of conducting research during
  a viral pandemic, poor reporting should not be accepted.'
